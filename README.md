# Wires

The "Wires Cycle" is a series of works for instruments that focuses on investigating the condition of the eternal present. This exploration centers on the perception of events, merging micro and macro-temporalities to experiment with a systemic relational condition of causes and effects. These tensions are expressed through scores that evolve over time, much like complex adaptive systems.
The pathways created over time are always different, yet they are interconnected by past choices that shape their future evolution. Each performance, therefore, maintains a balance of coherence and novelty, offering a new audible and expressive experiences for both the performers and the audience. This dynamic interplay ensures that no two performances are ever identical, while still preserving an underlying unity.
